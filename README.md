# What is it?

This code was rapidly adapted from old PHP code I wrote in college many years ago (caveat emptor!).

# Usage

See test.html.
Generally it should be used like:

```js
var result = convertNumber('Hiragana', '39.2');
// result = 'sanjuu kyuu ten ni';
```

Note that it expects a string as input.
